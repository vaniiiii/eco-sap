# Elliptic Curve Pairing Stealth Address Protocols

## Description

The `Elliptic Curve Pairing Stealth Address Protocols` project implements the protocols outlined in the [Elliptic Curve Pairing Stealth Address Protocols paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12131). This implementation's performance is benchmarked against the [BaseSAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14272) protocol across a variety of elliptic curves, including BN254 and BLS12-377, to demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency.
